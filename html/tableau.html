          <p>My goal is to graduate from the BYU Marriott School of Business with a degree in Finance. I will achieve this by studying hard, attending TA hours, and consistently working to earn strong grades. I will make sure to fully understand each assignment and seek help when needed. I will also build relationships with professors in my major so they know who I am and see my interest and dedication to the program.

          <p>
              My goal is to secure a full-time position at McKinsey and Company after graduation. To achieve this, I plan to network with friends and peers who currently work there to gain insights into what makes a strong candidate. I will also apply to their summer internship programs to gain hands-on experience, strengthen my resume, and improve my chances of receiving a full-time offer.

          <p> After I finish school and begin my career, my next dream is to start a family. I want to do this with someone I truly trust, love, and respect. I believe that starts with knowing who I am and not settling for less than what I deserve. I will keep working on myself and surround myself with people who support my values so that when the right time and person come along, I’ll be ready.

          <h2 class="post-title">Goal 4: Buy a Home and Create a Stable Foundation</h2>
          <img src="../images/home%20goal.webp" alt="A dream home representing future stability" width="600" height="550" style="margin: auto;">
          <p>
              One of my long-term goals is to purchase a home where I can build a life, create memories, and provide stability for my future family. I want this home to reflect the life I’ve worked hard to create — grounded, peaceful, and within my means.
          </p>
          <p>
              I plan to use the knowledge and skills from my finance degree to make smart, informed decisions during the home-buying process. I will research real estate markets, interest rates, and long-term affordability to ensure I'm getting the best deal possible. I will also take the time to find the right location — somewhere that aligns with my lifestyle, goals, and values.
          </p>
          <p>
              I will plan ahead by thinking about how many children I want to have, the kind of community I want to be part of, and what makes a home feel safe and permanent to me. I will save consistently, live within my means, and avoid unnecessary debt so that when the time comes, I’m ready not just financially — but emotionally and practically — to make that dream a reality.
